# calculator
The Mini Calculator is a simple, menu-driven command-line application developed in Python that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. Designed with user interaction and input validation in mind, it supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder (modulo) operations.

The calculator continuously prompts the user for operations and numbers until the user chooses to quit. It includes error handling for invalid input types (e.g., letters instead of numbers) and prevents common runtime issues like division by zero.
